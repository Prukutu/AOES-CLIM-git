### Where can I find Climate Datasets?

Many climate datasets are available on the COLA servers, but how do I find this data? Where would I look to find a dataset that is not on the COLA servers?  As I go forward in my research, how do I find datasets I might want to use?

1.  [COLA Datasets Catalog](https://kpegion.github.io/COLA-DATASETS-CATALOG/)  We are in the process of cataloging all the dataests on the COLA servers.
Not everything is there yet, but this is a good place to start if you want to know what data are available locally.

2. [NOAA/Physical Sciences Lab](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/)
Many climate datasets are here with lots of information and searching capabilities.  This is my go-to for finding climate datasets.

3. [IRI/LDEO Climate Data Library](https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/index.html?Set-Language=en)
This is another great resource for finding Climate Datasets

4. [NCAR Climate Data Guide](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/)
Great resource for getting expert advice on which datasets you should use for your specific application
